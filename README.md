## About Me

I am currently working on the interphase of math, data, and computers.

In a previous life, I did my PhD in mathematics at the [University of Michigan](https://lsa.umich.edu/math) under the supervision of [Mattias Jonsson](https://dept.math.lsa.umich.edu/~mattiasj/). Before that I was an undergraduate at [MIT](https://math.mit.edu). My research revolved around algebraic geometry, particularly over the p-adic numbers.
